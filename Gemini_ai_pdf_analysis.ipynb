The numbers (e.g., 1:160) represent the dilution of the sample at which the antibodies were still detectable.  Higher numbers suggest a greater likelihood of infection.\n",

            "\n",
            "**3. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):** This measures how quickly red blood cells settle at the bottom of a test tube.  A faster rate (higher ESR) can indicate inflammation or infection in the body.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **HbA1c 5.4%:**  This is within the normal range, indicating good blood sugar control and no evidence of diabetes.\n",

The other tests rule out dengue and malaria. The results should be discussed with the physician, Dr. Krishna Prasad, for interpretation and further action.  The doctor will consider this data alongside the patient's symptoms and medical history to reach a diagnosis.\n",
